# CrewAI Memory System Documentation

## Overview

The CrewAI memory system is a sophisticated multi-layered memory architecture designed to provide AI agents with different types of memory capabilities. The system is built with modularity and extensibility in mind, supporting various storage backends and memory types to handle different aspects of agent interactions and knowledge retention.

## Core Components

### 1. Base Memory System

The foundation of CrewAI's memory system is built on the `Memory` class, which provides:
- Basic save and search operations
- Support for metadata and agent tagging
- Integration with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) storage
- Configurable search parameters with score thresholds

```python
class Memory:
    def save(self, value, metadata=None, agent=None)
    def search(self, query, limit=3, score_threshold=0.35)
```

### 2. Memory Types

#### 2.1 Long-Term Memory (LTM)
Purpose: Manages persistent data across multiple runs and crew executions.

Features:
- Task-specific memory storage
- Quality scoring system
- Temporal tracking (datetime-based)
- Metadata enrichment
- SQLite-based storage backend

Key Components:
```python
class LongTermMemory:
    def save(self, item: LongTermMemoryItem)
    def search(self, task: str, latest_n: int = 3)
    def reset()
```

#### 2.2 Entity Memory
Purpose: Manages structured information about entities and their relationships.

Features:
- Entity type classification
- Relationship tracking
- Multiple storage backend support (SQLite, Mem0)
- Rich metadata support
- Customizable embeddings

Implementation:
```python
class EntityMemory:
    def save(self, item: EntityMemoryItem)
    def search(self, query: str)
```

#### 2.3 Short-Term Memory
Purpose: Handles temporary, session-based information.

Features:
- Immediate context retention
- Session-scoped storage
- Quick retrieval capabilities
- Temporary data management

#### 2.4 User Memory
Purpose: Maintains user interaction history and preferences.

Features:
- User interaction tracking
- Preference storage
- Historical context retention
- Personalization support
